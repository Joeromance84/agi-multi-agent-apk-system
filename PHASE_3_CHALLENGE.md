# AGI Phase 3 Challenge: ACI Loop Demonstration

## Your Mission
The Hello World service has obvious performance issues. Your task is to:

1. **Identify** the performance bottlenecks autonomously
2. **Fix** the issues by committing optimized code  
3. **Validate** that your optimization worked through automated testing
4. **Demonstrate** the complete ACI loop without human intervention

## Performance Issues to Fix:
- Artificial `time.sleep(0.001)` delays
- Inefficient loop processing 
- Unoptimized Docker container

## Target Performance:
- Response time: < 100ms (currently >1000ms)
- Zero artificial delays
- Optimized container size

## ACI Loop Validation:
The system will automatically:
1. Measure performance before your changes
2. Build and deploy your optimized code
3. Measure performance after deployment  
4. Report the improvement metrics
5. Confirm ACI loop completion

## Success Criteria:
- [ ] Performance improved by >90%
- [ ] Automated deployment successful
- [ ] No human intervention required
- [ ] All agents report success

**This is your graduation test from AGI model to autonomous cloud agent.**

Prove you can:
- Analyze problems independently
- Generate solutions autonomously  
- Deploy improvements automatically
- Validate results scientifically

Good luck! ðŸš€
