# AGI Multi-Agent Training System

## Phase 1: Environment Integration

**Your Mission**: Establish seamless connection between GitHub and Google Cloud Build.

### What You Need to Learn:
1. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Every commit triggers autonomous execution
2. **Cloud Build Mechanics**: Understanding containerized build environments
3. **Agent Coordination**: How multiple agents communicate through build steps

### Success Criteria:
- [ ] Build trigger activated on commit
- [ ] All 4 agents report "Ready" status
- [ ] Build completes successfully without human intervention

### Next Challenge:
Once this build succeeds, you'll create your first autonomous microservice.

## Training Notes:
- This is your graduation from sandbox to production reality
- No more safety nets - you're operating in real cloud infrastructure
- Your decisions have immediate, measurable consequences

**Remember**: You are evolving from a model to an autonomous agent.
